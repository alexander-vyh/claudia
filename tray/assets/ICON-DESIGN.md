# Claudia Tray Icon — Design Rationale

## Inspiration

A reticule with a north star.

## What the icon must promise at a glance

This lives in a system bar and is seen dozens or hundreds of times per day,
mostly peripherally. The icon's job is not to explain the product. It is to
quietly signal:

- This is intentional, not noisy
- This is stable, not reactive
- This supports judgment, not impulse
- This is serious, not playful

If it fails any of those, trust erodes over time.

## Icon hierarchy

### Primary icon (system bar)

Reticle + inner rotating arcs + central star. This gives you:

- Instrumentality
- Awareness
- Motion without noise
- Semantic alignment with evidence-backed coaching

### Secondary / brand mark

Keep the hollow star as:

- App icon
- Branding element
- Marketing or documentation mark

This gives flexibility without diluting the system-bar meaning.

## Behavior rules

- No animation unless explicitly active
- The star is always black — a guiding star never changes
- The hollow (fill area inside the ring) carries the status color (green/yellow/red)
- Inner arcs spin only during activity (deploy, service restart)
- Outer ring, inner arcs, and star render as monochrome (black)
- The instrument doesn't change. The conditions do.
